    <p>Subscription-Based Influence. Open-Source Ethics. Collective Growth.</p>

      <h2>Decentralized Governance with Subscriber Influence</h2>
      <p>3DVR is more than a tech company — it's a community-powered system. Your subscription is your vote. As a subscriber, you help guide our direction, and the more you support, the more you influence.</p>
      <div class="level">
        <strong>Free Tier:</strong> Read-only access to updates, public voting snapshots, and community involvement.
      </div>
      <div class="level">
        <strong>Basic Member ($20/mo):</strong> Participate in votes, access all services, join strategy discussions.
      </div>
      <div class="level">
        <strong>Boosted Membership (2x+ Subscriptions):</strong> Each additional $20/mo boosts your influence proportionally, treated as recurring investment.
      </div>
      <div class="level">
        <strong>Top Contributors:</strong> Gain access to key strategic decisions, proposal rights, and voting weight in company governance.
      </div>
    </section><section>
  <h2>Security & Abuse Protection</h2>
  <p>All voting and proposal systems are transparent and open-source. Weighted influence is public, and abuse is mitigated by community oversight, time-based cooldowns, and transparency logs. Our goal is to keep 3DVR safe, fair, and collectively run.</p>

  <h2>From Subscription to Full Hardware Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>We start by offering value-packed services for $20/month: websites, apps, consulting, and unlimited tech support. As subscriptions grow, we funnel funds into open-source development of laptops, phones, and modular tools designed by and for our community.</p>
  <p>Eventually, our vision is to <strong>offer hardware itself as part of your $20/month membership</strong> — laptops, devices, and even off-grid gear. Yes, it seems radical, but when value creation is shared with the community, it's not about big profits — it's about big impact.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Giving Back to Our Community</h2>
  <p>We don’t believe in hoarding profits. 3DVR is designed to be a regenerative system where <strong>employees and subscribers both benefit</strong>. As we grow, so do you. Whether through tech dividends, increased decision power, or access to cutting-edge tools — we’re in this together.</p>
